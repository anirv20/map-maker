# Low-Fi Custom Map Maker
This project is a low-fi custom map generator. It is made with Python and Pygame. It has options to make custom maps, as well as generating a random map using perlin noise.
The program has different 'biomes'. When you place a piece of land, it recognizes the tiles next to it, and automatically displays a fitting tile.
